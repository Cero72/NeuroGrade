System design is a crucial phase in software development where architects create a detailed plan for a complex system, including its architecture, modules, data management, interfaces, scalability, reliability, and performance. This blueprint ensures that the system meets requirements and functions efficiently. By carefully considering various factors, such as user needs and technical constraints, system designers aim to create robust and effective solutions that fulfill stakeholders' expectations.
