convolational Neural Networks (ONS ) are a type of deep learning architecture well-suited for processing grid-like data, such as images. The key components of a CNN are : The Constitutional lawyers. Apple's reasonable filters to the input data, capturing local patterns and features. A. Pooling lawyers : Down sample the spatial dimensions of feature maps, reducing complexity and providing translation invariance. B. partially connected layers : combine the learned features to make predictions or classifications. The conventional and pooling lawyers extract features from the input, while the fully connected lawyers perform the final task. calls are not effective for image processing due to their ability to capture spatial and local correlations.
